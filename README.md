# CS-Challenge-ENICarthage

This is the Project Prototype made By IEEE ENICarthage Computer Society Student Chapter for the "Tunisians Students and Young Profesionnals 9th edition"'s CS Challenge named "MyBousta".

## What is MyBousta ?

MyBousta is a platform developped to reduce Stress on Tunisian Posts, but how does it achieve that ?
Well, to begin with, MyBousta will use a database shared with other governmental institutions that contains citizens' (who are registered to the platform) paperwork since the creation of their account.
Mybousta then will re-use those document (if valid or not expired) which will greatly decrease stress on those institutions, also, when using Mybousta, a form will appear containing additionnal informations needed to complete those services.
By doing that, the user will only have to go to a Tunisian Post branch (If needed, by booking an appointment) for signing papers, contracts, etc...

## How can i see the project ?

After getting the project on your machine open the folders location in your command line tool of your choice (or in the terminal in VS Code) and type the command `npm install` then type the command `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`
